# Django Demo

## Things You May Need
- Python installed. Try typing `python --version` into your console. If you do not have it installed, dowload the latest version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Once Python is verified, install Django via this command line `pip install django`.

## Launching
To get started all you have to do is navigate to `<this_dir>/Django` and type into the console `python manage.py runserver`.

Then open your favorite browser and navigate to *localhost:8000/zc_demo/index*. That's it. 

Also, note that you can interact with the rendered ZingChart to change any configuration you want by right clicking anywhere on the chart
and selecting 'View Source'. From there you can add, modify, or remove anything you like. Visit [zingchart](http://www.zingchart.com/docs/json-attributes-syntax/) for more information on how to customize your charts.

**Happy Charting**
